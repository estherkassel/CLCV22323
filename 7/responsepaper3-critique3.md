# Digital Critiques 3

## Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (TLL)

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - The website indicates that the Thesaurus has been available online since 2003 and the online version is currently supported by its publisher, De Gruyter. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

C - The website does not restrict its content for viewers, however not all volumes are published online for free, and much of the content is not Creative Commons and requires users to cite Thesaurus articles. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

B - The Thesaurus organizes itself by volumes and lemmas and provides links to a headword search on a different website as well as links for certain words/lemmas in alphabetical order on the main page. The website also provides an index, but you can only search using their search bar based on the first letter of the index. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

C - The content is downloadable as a PDF file, but because the website is focused on TLL specifically and is supported by its publisher, the only other linked website is the TLL Open Access website supported by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.
