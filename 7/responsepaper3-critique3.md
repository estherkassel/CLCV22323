# Response Paper 3
A historical gazetteer is essentially a place-locator used by historical researchers to locate historical places and areas; however, a gazetteer is not a map, rather, the article describes it as a “complement to a map.” While not all gazetteers must or can provide the exact coordinates of a place (some places may be “lost” in history), they are required to provide the name of the place, a location or footprint, and a feature type, which is a data set from some data source. An example of a historical gazetter is Pleiades. Unlike its predecessor, Barrington Atlas, which was a physical resource transferred almost exactly into a digital copy, Pleiades was designed with a “wiki approach” in mind, meaning users have the ability to update places themselves. Further, the creators of Pleiades built the website with the intention of providing more conceptual ideas about places instead of just maps. While the website does provide geological locations of places, it is not the focus; places are treated as conceptual entities with accurate coordinates as a bonus. Pleiades’ platform also allows more flexibility than Barrington Atlas: it has the ability to indicate uncertainties of places, relationships between places, change over time (such as name change), and link information to other resources. 


# Digital Critiques 3

## Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (TLL)

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - The website indicates that the Thesaurus has been available online since 2003 and the online version is currently supported by its publisher, De Gruyter. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

C - The website does not restrict its content for viewers, however not all volumes are published online for free, and much of the content is not Creative Commons and requires users to cite Thesaurus articles. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

B - The Thesaurus organizes itself by volumes and lemmas and provides links to a headword search on a different website as well as links for certain words/lemmas in alphabetical order on the main page. The website also provides an index, but you can only search using their search bar based on the first letter of the index. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

C - The content is downloadable as a PDF file, but because the website is focused on TLL specifically and is supported by its publisher, the only other linked website is the TLL Open Access website supported by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. 

## Digital Maps of the Ancient World

- Permanence and Sustainability

C - It appears that this website is supported and updated entirely by one person, which is okay right now since all of the links still work; however, because of the lack of support, there is less permanence, further, there is no third-party depository to sustain the content. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

B - The creator of the website does not indicate if they used Creative Commons photos, however, all of their content is available to view without any restrictions. The creator also does not provide any indication of whether or not web users can download and use the content. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

B - The website provides a multitude of different media, such as maps, which are both in jpg format and as an interactive Google map, Greek and Latin texts translated into English (yet there is no text search function), and photos of artwork. The media is searchable by a bar on the top of the screen. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

C - Photo media is non-machine readable, for the most part, only available to download in jpg form, and there are no links to other URIs.
