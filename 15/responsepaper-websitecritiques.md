# Response Paper:

SPARQL is defined as a query language, since it expresses queries across various databases, and a fundamental tool of Linked Open Data (LOD). After retrieving the queries, SPARQL can be used to modify and present the data, as well as allow proper LOD circulation of the data through an RDF file. Unliked other programming languages, SPARQL allows for greater flexibility--particularly when implemented through an iPython notebook--and better representation of the data.

# Critique of two digital tools

## The Ancient Graffiti Project

- Permanence and Sustainability

A- - The first version of the website was created in 2017 and the current version is now the fifth version, displaying a fair amount of stability. However, some of their links take you to the first version of the website for some reason.

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

A - The content is available as a photograph and/or as drawing of the inscription, with its original text and a translation or description of the inscription. All content is under a Creative Commons liscence. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

A - There are several ways to search through the data, including searching specific words (in English, Latin, or Greek), searching through interactive maps provided, or through the search function which provides several areas of interest including city and language. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

B - The website links to affiliated groups/partners, which contain images and descriptions of various epigraphs, most of which are from the areas of interest from the original website. The text content is available to download in several machine-readable formats.

## Kenchreai Archaeological Archive

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - The archive has been going strong for about a decade now, as it was apparently created in 2013. The links continue to work. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

B - All data is accessible to access and look at, but is not under a Creative Commons liscence, so therefore all of the images and information provided is available for personal use only. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

B - The search function is relatively easy to use, however, only the titles of the data are truly searchable. Thankfully, many of them are descriptive in terms of object and location, but the content is still difficult to navigate.  

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

A - Links to other datab and uses URIs. Additionally, at the bottom of every page, their GitHub is linked.
