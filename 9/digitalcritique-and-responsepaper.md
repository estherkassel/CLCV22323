## The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls

- Permanence and Sustainability

B/A - Since the content is based on digital copies of scrolls from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and supported by Google, the content seems to hold a relatively high level of permanence. Further, because of the little data provided by the website, it seems to be sustained well. However, they did mention that they do not want people commenting on the website anymore, which constitutes a lack of sustainability, but not a significant lack. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

B - The content is viewable to all without payment or profile, but the website states that all the content provided by the website is copyrighted, which limits external use of content.

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

C - Translations are not available for all the texts provided; the website provides a scroll function, but there is no clear text search function. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

C - The site's contents are not freely downloadable and even then, it is not clear if the content provided digitally would be machine-readable. 

## The Homer Multitext project

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - There appear to be updated versions of the pages that are linked and all links are currently working; the homepage links to other third-party databases. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

A - Available to all users without any payment or login and content is stated to be under Creative Commons.

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

C - The downloadable texts are not searchable, however, the editions of manuscripts and the HMT browser have basic search functions for the sections of the texts; the text search function is more technical for the editions and perhaps more useful for a scholar than someone attempting to find a word or phrase in the text. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

B - Texts are only available in .txt, .md, and .pdf format; however, the homepage links their GitHub repository, which allows for more connectivity across resources
