# Response Paper

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are databases used by geographers and others that use geographical resources to analyze information via various technologies that are stored in the database. A GIS is able to synthesize information more readily than traditional geographical techniques, however, the database has the ability to also support traditional methods through data integration. Overall, a GIS is able to input, store, transform, and report data for various geographical topics, including archeological research. For example, in the paper Cult and Crisis: A GIS Approach to the Sacred Landscape of Hellenistic Attica, a GIS is used to map sites in Attika that indicate hindered cult practice as well as military landscapes. In this context, GIS is used as a supplementary method of research; the goal of the researchers is that, after submitting the textual data into a GIS, it will aid them in developing more specific, object-based inquiries about cults in Attika that were affected by military presence in the 3rd century. However, the researchers have identified certain limitations when using GIS technology; for one, there is an unknown number of objects at the sites that they are investigating, and second, not all of the archeological data that could aid the project is published. Despite limitations, the study in the paper concluded that the GIS provided consistent and useful information.

# Digital Critiques

## The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls

- Permanence and Sustainability

B/A - Since the content is based on digital copies of scrolls from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and supported by Google, the content seems to hold a relatively high level of permanence. Further, because of the little data provided by the website, it seems to be sustained well. However, they did mention that they do not want people commenting on the website anymore, which constitutes a lack of sustainability, but not a significant lack. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

B - The content is viewable to all without payment or profile, but the website states that all the content provided by the website is copyrighted, which limits external use of content.

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

C - Translations are not available for all the texts provided; the website provides a scroll function, but there is no clear text search function. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

C - The site's contents are not freely downloadable and even then, it is not clear if the content provided digitally would be machine-readable. 

## The Homer Multitext project

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - There appear to be updated versions of the pages that are linked and all links are currently working; the homepage links to other third-party databases. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

A - Available to all users without any payment or login and content is stated to be under Creative Commons.

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

C - The downloadable texts are not searchable, however, the editions of manuscripts and the HMT browser have basic search functions for the sections of the texts; the text search function is more technical for the editions and perhaps more useful for a scholar than someone attempting to find a word or phrase in the text. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

B - Texts are only available in .txt, .md, and .pdf format; however, the homepage links their GitHub repository, which allows for more connectivity across resources
