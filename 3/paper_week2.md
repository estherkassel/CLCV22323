# "Think Python" Reading Response 1

Downey defines various coding terms—a variable, a parameter, and an argument—and describes how each functions individually and together in code. A variable is defined as “a name that refers to a value.” For example, in the statement n = 6, the variable name refers to the value 6, an integer. Variables can be arbitrarily long and contain letters and numbers, but cannot begin with a number. For example, message = “Hello” has an appropriate variable of “Hello”, but n = 34class does not. Parameters and arguments are applied to functions, which are sequences of statements. A parameter is a type of variable used in a function and works with the argument. For example, in a print_twice(cat) function, “cat” is the parameter that will be repeated twice. An argument of a function can be any kind of expression given to the function; for example, the expression in parenthesis x = math.tan(degrees/math.pi + 7) is an argument. Arguments can also be the same as variables; in the instance of this function, the variable and the argument are both s1:

>>> s1 = class 
>>> print_twice(s1)
class
class 

While variable, parameter, and argument are distinct terms, they do overlap in applicability and definition. Downey articulates these complicated distinctions well.
