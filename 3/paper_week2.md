# "Think Python" Reading Response 1

Downey defines various coding terms—a variable, a parameter, and an argument—and describes how each functions individually and together in code. A variable is defined as “a name that refers to a value.” For example, in the statement n = 6, the variable name refers to the value 6, an integer. Variables can be arbitrarily long and contain letters and numbers, but cannot begin with a number. For example, message = “Hello” has an appropriate variable of “Hello”, but n = 34class does not. Parameters and arguments are applied to functions, which are sequences of statements. A parameter is a type of variable used in a function and works with the argument. For example, in a print_twice(cat) function, “cat” is the parameter that will be repeated twice. An argument of a function can be any kind of expression given to the function; for example, the expression in parenthesis x = math.tan(degrees/math.pi + 7) is an argument. Arguments can also be the same as variables; in the instance of this function, the variable and the argument are both s1:

> s1 = class

> print_twice(s1)

class

class 

While variable, parameter, and argument are distinct terms, they do overlap in applicability and definition. Downey articulates these complicated distinctions well. 

# Digital Critique 1

## Pleiades

- Permanence and sustainability

A - This website is supported by ancient world institutions at NYU and UNC as well as individual contributors and seems to be updated often (with many of their pages updated in 2023). I believe that the contribution and support of both universities and individuals support the excellent permanence and sustainability of this website. 

- Openness or restriction of their data

A - While there is the possibility of creating an account for Pleiades for the purpose of contributing, there is no restriction to accessing materials on the website. On the “Participate” page, the editors make it clear that they have no intention of restricting their data and articulate the steps for joining clearly. 

- Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data

B - The search function, particularly the advanced search function, and linked sources are easy to access and maneuver; the website also provides interactive maps, descriptions, and links to community-provided photos. However, depending on the categorization, certain places can be difficult to find, and with the lack of photos and low-quality maps, users may not be provided with complete information. 

- Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)

A - Pleiades provides several alternate representations for each of their Places page, including Atom, JSON, KML, RDF+XML, and Turtle.
