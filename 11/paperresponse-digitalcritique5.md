## Response Paper 5

3D modeling is used to collect, store, and visually represent data from an archeological site. There are various techniques used to 3D model the data, which include structured light, which is the process of projecting a pattern onto an object and obtaining its shape via deformation in the pattern, and structure-from-motion, which uses 2D images to estimate a 3D structure. Photogrammetry, a procedure of collecting data for image-based modeling, is an efficient tool for archeologists to record artifacts, various contexts of excavations, and architectural remains. 

## Digital Critique 5

# Pompeii: 3D-explorer

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - All of the links are still functioning, and the last entry on their website’s blog was fairly recent: Oct 1, 2023. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

A - All of the data is under a Creative Commons license, but it is stored on another website called DataHeritage; through DataHeritage, which is linked from the CyArk website, you are able to sign a form to have the downloadable data sent to your email.

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

A - The maps provided on the website are all interactive and include clickable information tabs; the website itself is easy to maneuver and the maps/projects are searchable both by keyword and by exhibit type. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

B - The data provided is stored in DataHeritage, which provides the description of the site, the DOI, and a link to request the downloadable data via email. The data appears to not be downloadable as an RDF file, so it does not use open standards. 

# Searchable Greek Inscriptions (PHI)

- Permanence and Sustainability

B - The website acknowledges on “The PHI Epigraphy Project” page that it needs to improve its support and gain more collaborators in order to sustain itself, however, it does not seem to have resolved this issue yet. So far, all of the links continue to work and the last update was in July of 2023. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

C - You’re able to look at the content without any payment or needing to log in. However, it seems that none of the data is obviously downloadable for the user. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

A - The website allows for text search in both English and Greek, including incomplete words or phrases. You are also able to search by region and by bibliography. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

B - I believe all or most of the data is also on the SEG database, but as far as I can tell, there is no direct link from an inscription on PHI to its counterpart on the SEG database or any third-party database.
