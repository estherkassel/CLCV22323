# Response Paper 2

Data normalization is the cohesive organization of data by arranging it on a table or multiple tables. To complete the process of data normalization, the first, second, and third normal forms must be checked and/or completed. The first normal formâ€™s goal is to establish unique rows, make sure every cell on the table has a single value, not a list, and divide any compound elements in a cell. The goal of the second normal form is to check that the data is in the first normal form, first and foremost, and then it is to eliminate any non-partial dependency. This means that if a column is not completely dependent on the primary or composite key, which is a key made of two or more items, so the composite key must be moved to its own table. Finally, the goal of the third normal form is to be in the first and second normal forms, and then to make sure that all of the columns are determined by the composite or primary key. If a column is determined by another column that is not part of the composite key, then those the undetermined column and the one it is dependent on must be copied onto another table.
