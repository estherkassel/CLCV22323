# Response Paper:

AI has the potential to contribute to historical studies and other research ventures, especially since its features are argued to correspond to that of a historian. Further, AI has been promoted as the future of technology, the savior of humanity, and has the potential to expand intelligence. However, AI, especially AGI (artificially generated intelligence), has demonstrated sociopolitical drawbacks. How AI “learns” appears to be magical, but in actuality, the machines can gather, classify, interpret, and store data through advanced programming. Machine learning reflects the processes of historians. Further, AI has been particularly present in social and political events, such as presidential elections. As a result, there has become a push among historians to consider AI in the developments of the last several decades. Therefore, not only does AI have the potential to model historical research (and other professions “centered on particularity” such as legal and clinical careers), but it has also become a more relevant factor in modern history. Some dangers seem to inherently be tied to AI; for example, the AI recommendation algorithms sometimes lead to polarization, causing real social and political divides. Further, AI, specifically AGI, has proven to have certain global risks, especially with its political ally, neoliberalism. AGI is argued to reinforce destructive biases, such as market bias, which empowers private over public actors, and adaption bias, proving that AGI often does not solve a problem, rather, it forces society to adapt to the problem, and efficiency bias, which argues that efficiency ought to be considered over social issues. 

# Critique of two digital tools

## Logeion

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - All of the links still work, the website has been posting updates for the last 10 years, and it uses third-party deposits, particularly other online Ancient Greek and Latin dictionaries. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

B - The content is not explicitly charging license fees nor is it clearly under a Creative Commons license, but the content is downloadable in a .txt file. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

A - The search function is easy to use, especially if you know exactly what word(s) you are looking for. 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

C - Content is machine-readable, but not necessarily under the principles of LOD nor does it directly link to the sources when it uses them for dictionary definitions. 

## OCHRE: An Online Cultural and Historical Research Environment [Software]

- Permanence and Sustainability

A - There have been updates on the “Wiki” page since 2014 and all of the links continue to work. 

- Openness or Restriction of their Data

B - Does not include Creative Commons license on Private Policy page. However, the software appears to be available to view without charging the user. 

- Functionality of their Interface and Interaction with their Data

A - The website is easy to use and a search function is provided, though it ambiguously searches through all of the tabs that post unique content (Project Gallery, Publications, etc.). 

- Connectivity Across Resources (Under the Principles of Linked Open Data)

A - The software’s conformation to LOD standards is written clearly on the introduction page.
