# Response Paper

The articles emphasized the lack of interactivity and immobility of objects in museums; only very rarely can a visitor directly interact with a historical object. Integrated augmented reality (AR) has the ability to provide visitors with a deeper understanding of a cultural object or artwork and facilitates interactions between the visitors and the visitors and the object, allowing for a more engaging museum experience. Similarly, archeological concerns real-life historical objects, sometimes completely in situ. AR, then, provides the possibility of interactive education, field training, and data interpretation for archeologists, both on and off of the field.
